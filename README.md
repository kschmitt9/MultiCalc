# Multivarable Calculus
Here I provide demonstrations and the code I used in my multivariable calculus course I taught during the summer 2023 at the University of Cincinnati.

## Vectors, Dot and Cross Products, Equations of Lines, Planes, and Surfaces

The content here is contained in the 'Vectors_Planes_Surfaces' folder, roughly covering chapter 12 of Stewart's *Early Transcendentals* and chapter 1 of Milavcic's *Illustrative Guide to Multivariable Calculus*. The highlights are **(1)** visualizing vector operations and **(2)** surfaces generated by conic sections (quadric surfaces).

## Vector-valued functions, Space Curves, Brief Vector Calculus, Arclength and Curvature

The content here is contained in the 'Curvature_VectorFunctions' folder, covering 13.1-13.3 of Stewart's *Early Transcendentals*. The highlights are **(1)** animations for space curves and **(2)** animating the circle of curvature, and the normal, tangent, and binormal vectors as the curve is traversed in time (there is an option to include the normal and osculating plane). Included is **(3)** a project on the Archytas curve.

## Functions of Several Variables, Partial Derivatives, The Gradient

## Multiple Integration

## Vector Calculus
